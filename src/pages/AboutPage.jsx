      <p style={{ color: "#4b5563", marginBottom: 18 }}>
        Rootd was created from a simple observation — while NIL opportunities have opened new doors
        for college athletes, most deals go to the few already in the spotlight. Thousands of
        dedicated athletes still struggle to connect with local businesses that would genuinely
        align with their values, interests, and communities.
      </p>
      <p style={{ color: "#4b5563", marginBottom: 18 }}>
        At the same time, small and mid-sized businesses often want to support local programs but
        don’t know where to start. They lack the resources to reach athletes directly or navigate
        NIL compliance, leaving potential partnerships untapped.
      </p>
      <p style={{ color: "#4b5563", marginBottom: 18 }}>
        Rootd bridges that gap. By combining a guided personality quiz, AI-driven matching, and
        simple communication tools, Rootd helps athletes discover authentic partnerships with
        hometown brands — coffee shops, gyms, boutiques, startups — that share their story and
        support their journey. Each connection strengthens the local ecosystem while giving athletes
        a fairer shot at meaningful NIL opportunities.
      </p>
      <p style={{ color: "#4b5563" }}>
        We’re rooted in the belief that NIL isn’t just about deals — it’s about community. Rootd
        exists to help athletes grow where they’re planted, one partnership at a time.
